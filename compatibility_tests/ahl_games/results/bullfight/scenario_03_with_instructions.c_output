                                  BULL
               CREATIVE COMPUTING  MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY



DO YOU WANT INSTRUCTIONS? YES
HELLO, ALL YOU BLOODLOVERS AND AFICIONADOS.
HERE IS YOUR BIG CHANCE TO KILL A BULL.

ON EACH PASS OF THE BULL, YOU MAY TRY
0 - VERONICA (DANGEROUS INSIDE MOVE OF THE CAPE)
1 - LESS DANGEROUS OUTSIDE MOVE OF THE CAPE
2 - ORDINARY SWIRL OF THE CAPE.

INSTEAD OF THE ABOVE, YOU MAY TRY TO KILL THE BULL
ON ANY TURN: 4 (OVER THE HORNS), 5 (IN THE CHEST).
BUT IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T TRY IT BEFORE THE SEVENTH PASS.

THE CROWD WILL DETERMINE WHAT AWARD YOU DESERVE
(POSTHUMOUSLY IF NECESSARY).
THE BRAVER YOU ARE, THE BETTER THE AWARD YOU RECIEVE.

THE BETTER THE JOB THE PICADORES AND TOREADORES DO,
THE BETTER YOUR CHANCES ARE.


YOU HAVE DRAWN A GOOD BULL.

THE PICADORES DID A POOR JOB.
ONE OF THE PICADORES WAS KILLED.

THE TOREADORES DID A GOOD JOB.
