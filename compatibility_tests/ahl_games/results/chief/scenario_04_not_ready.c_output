I AM CHIEF NUMBERS FREEK, THE GREAT INDIAN MATH GOD.
ARE YOU READY TO TAKE THE TEST YOU CALLED ME OUT FOR? NO
SHUT UP, PALE FACE WITH WISE TONGUE.
 TAKE A NUMBER AND ADD 3. DIVIDE THIS NUMBER BY 5 AND
MULTIPLY BY 8. DIVIDE BY 5 AND ADD THE SAME. SUBTRACT 1.

WHAT WAS YOUR ORIGINAL NUMBER? 
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART, EH?
NOW WATCH.
 0 PLUS 3 EQUALS 3 . THIS DIVIDED BY 5 EQUALS .6 ;
THIS TIMES 8 EQUALS 4.8 . IF WE DIVIDE BY 5 AND ADD 5,
WE GET 5.96 , WHICH, MINUS 1, EQUALS 4.96 .
